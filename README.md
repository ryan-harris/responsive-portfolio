# Responsive Portfolio

This project uses the Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive website to showcase a portfolio.  The website has 3 pages, a Home/About Me page, a Portfolio page, and a Contact page.

The website is responsive to screen size changes so that every page looks good on both a mobile phone and desktop computer.
