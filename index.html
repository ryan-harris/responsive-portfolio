            <!-- About me text content-->
            <p>My name is Ryan Harris and I'm a professional software developer.  I graduated from UCLA in 2011 with a bachelor's degree in computer science.  During my time at UCLA, I trained primarily in C++ before accepting a Java deveoper role at Teradata.  I worked as a Java developer for Teradata between 2012 and 2017.  In 2017 I left software development behind to pursue some other interests, but ultimately decided to return back to programming in 2020.</p>
            <p>The product we made at Teradata was called Teradata Studio, which was a GUI desktop application for database administration, SQL query development, data transfers, and manageement tasks for Teradata, Aster, and Hadoop databases.  During my time there I developed a wide variety of features, including an enhanced SQL editor, a data transfer feature, file input and output for loading/exporting tables, wizards to assist users to create/modify database schemas, users, and other objects, and Hadoop connectivity.  In addition to writing Java, I also managed the team's automated build and testing environments using Teamcity and Git.  I led the effort to migrate our code base from Subversion to Git while preserving all the Subversion commit history (and there were years of it!).  I also setup and managed Hadoop clusters for development and testing purposes.</p>
